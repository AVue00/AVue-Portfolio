            <p>
                Hello! My name is Alex, and I am a aspiring web developer with an interest for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. 
                I have experience using React with languages of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                Other technologies I have exposure to are TypeScript and SQL.
                Currently I am a Controls Engineer at an automotive supplier company and program PLCs using ladder logic.
                In my free time, I enjoy learning programming languages/techniques, playing/watching sports and fishing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to connect with me on my social media channels or check out my portfolio to see some of my work. 
                I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations!
            </p>
